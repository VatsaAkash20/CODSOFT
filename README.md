# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project uses data from the Titanic disaster to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Build a model that answers: *What kinds of people were more likely to survive?*

## 💡 Methodology
- Binary classification problem
- Used Logistic Regression
- Features used: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

## ✅ Steps
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Selection
- Model Training using Logistic Regression
- Predictions for all 891 passengers

## 📁 Files Included
- `titanic_project.ipynb`: Colab notebook with code
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Dataset file
